Predicting the Conversion from CIS to MS: An Explainable Machine Learning Approach

This study utilizes a public dataset of **273 Mexican mestizo CIS patients** with a **10-year follow-up** to predict the conversion of **Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS)** to **Clinically Definite Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS)**. The dataset was divided into a **training set** for cross-validation and feature selection, and a **holdout test set** for final testing. 

An explainable machine learning model, **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**, was employed for the analysis. Feature importance was determined using the **SHapley Additive Explanations library (SHAP)**.
